# University College London PhD thesis 

This is a template of PhD thesis that attempts to follow the [requirements of University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/current-students/research_degrees/thesis_formatting).

Please keep in mind that it is NOT an official template and it is not supported by UCL.

An example of how the class is used is given in the `example.tex` file. You may use class options `oneside` / `twoside` *(whether to format one-sided or two-sided)* and other options from [LaTeX memoir class](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir?lang=en)
