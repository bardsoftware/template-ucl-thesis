# PhD thesis class for LaTeX

**by Rob Stanley** robert.stanley.10@ucl.ac.uk

A PhD thesis class for LaTeX that attempts to follow the [UCL thesis requirements](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/current-students/research_degrees/thesis_formatting) based on the [LaTeX memoir class](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir?lang=en).

**This package is not supported by UCL.**

Only compilation with XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX is currently supported.

## Installation and usage

Copy the `phdthesis.cls` file to the directory containing the thesis LaTeX file.
No additional files are needed.

An example of how the class is used is given in the `example.tex` file.

## Optional class options
* `oneside` / `twoside` *(whether to format one-sided or two-sided)*

See the [LaTeX memoir class](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir?lang=en) for more options.
